ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MicheleIarossi

I'm a software engineer with 20 years of experience in embedded computing, focusing on embedded software development. My expertise includes classic AUTOSAR and diagnostic protocols (e.g. UDS). I thrive on leading, mentoring and working with multicultural teams. I have strong communication skills in German (C2), English (C2), French (B2) and Italian (native).

My favourite quote:

*Quelli che s'innamorano di pratica senza scienza son come il nocchiere, che entra in naviglio senza timone o bussola, che mai ha certezza dove si vada* - Leonardo da Vinci

(He who loves practice without theory is like the sailor who boards ship without a rudder and compass and never knows where he may cast - Leonardo da Vinci)

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MicheleIarossi

I'm a seasoned software engineer with 15+ years of experience in the automotive sector, focusing on embedded software development and integration. My expertise includes AUTOSAR, diagnostic protocols and embedded programming. I thrive on leading, mentoring and working with multicultural teams in complex and challenging projects. I have strong communication skills in German, English, Italian, and French.

My favourite quote:

*Quelli che s'innamorano di pratica senza scienza son come il nocchiere, che entra in naviglio senza timone o bussola, che mai ha certezza dove si vada* - Leonardo da Vinci

(He who loves practice without theory is like the sailor who boards ship without a rudder and compass and never knows where he may cast - Leonardo da Vinci)
